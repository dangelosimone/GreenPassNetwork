# GreenPassNetwork
The Project aims to design and implement a Green Pass management service according to certain specifications. 
The user who uses the service, once the vaccination has been carried out, connects to the vaccination center 
to which he communicates the code of his health card, the center will provide the customer with a green pass that can be validated or not. 
The customer can also invalidate or restore the validity of the Green Pass by communicating any contagion or healing.
The project in question is written in C language, using sockets for communication between processes. 
The project was carried out using exclusively UNIX platforms, specifically Arch Linux and MacOS.
